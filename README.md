# Password-Generator

This is a Password Generator web application that allows users to create secure, random passwords based on customizable criteria. 
The interface lets users specify the password length (4 to 20 characters) and choose whether to include uppercase letters, 
lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. After selecting preferences, users can click the "Generate Password" button to generate 
a password. The password can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the clipboard button. The page uses JavaScript for functionality
and Font Awesome for icons, with styling applied through custom CSS.
